    Blockcore Vault is built upon some of the newest in decentralized technology and blockchain related software,
    making it use of new terminology that has not yet been widely adopted or settled.

  <p>Some of the terminology within Blockcore Vault can change, depending on feedback from users, community and the
    standard groups.</p>

  <h2>Vocabulary</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Vault: </strong> The product name for our offering that supports multiple open standards in the same
    software. Vault implements various open standards to different degrees. This normally referes to a single
    deployed instance of the Blockcore Vault software.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Verifiable Data Registry: </strong> This is what the Blockcore Vault software is.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Identity Vault: </strong> A specialized Vault (see below) that holds DID Documents (see below). The
    documents stored in the Identity Vault can be retrieved using REST APIs and using DID Resolvers.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Data Vault: </strong> Single instance of an data vault that is hosted on a Blockcore Vault instance.
    The data vault is created by submitting an <em>data vault configuration</em> to the
    Blockcore Vault. The data vault configuration contains setup for replication, synchronization, conflict resolution,
    access control and more.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Vault Operator: </strong> Any entity, including individuals, who runs an Blockcore Vault Instance on a
    device or
    infrastructure they control.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Vault User: </strong> An entity that controls the private key to control an DID and transmits messages via
    an Vault, which may be running on a device in their possession, or on the device or infrastructure of a Vault
    Operator.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Decentralized Identifiers (DID): </strong> Unique ID URI string and PKI metadata document format for
    describing
    the cryptographic keys and other fundamental PKI values linked to a unique, user-controlled, self-sovereign
    identifier in a target system (e.g., blockchain, distributed ledger). <a

  </p>

  <p><strong>DID Document: </strong> A document that describes keys and other information about an DID Subject.
  </p>

  <p><strong>DID Resolver: </strong> A library / code that allows lookup of DID Documents against an "DID Registry"/"DID
    Hub". Learn more at <a

  </p>

  <p><strong>Verifiable Credential (VC): </strong> Verifiable Credentials, a signed JSON-document that contains link to
    specific DID that performed the signing.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Identity Profile (Identity Hub Profile): </strong> This is a signed VC with metadata regarding a specific
    DID. Can describe information about an Vault instance, computer, serverm service, business or corporate entity or
    individual. See example: <a

  <p><strong>Well Known DID Configuration: </strong> A document that exists on an known URL on a running Vault and
    returns information regarding the DID of a specific instance. <a

  </p>

  <p><strong>Well Known Vault Configuration: </strong> A document that exists on an known URL on a running Vault and
